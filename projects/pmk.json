  "text": "Perception and Manipulation knowledge framework (PMK) presents a standardized ontology framework for autonomous robot perception and manipulation, which follows the IEEE standards 1872 of representing knowledge for the robotic domain. Moreover, an inference mechanism for reasoning over the knowledge is included, which enhances the planning of manipulation tasks. A perception module can be integrated with the framework to capture a rich semantic description of the scene, knowledge about the physical behavior of the objects, and reasoning about the potential manipulation actions. The reasoning scope of PMK is divided into four parts: reasoning for perception, the reasoning for object features, the reasoning for a situation, and reasoning for planning.",
