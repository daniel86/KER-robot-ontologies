  "text": "ORO is a project focused on the implementation of a common representation frameworkfor autonomous robots with special emphasizes on human-robot interaction. The proposed framework was meant to enhance robotâ€™s interactionwith complex and human-inhabited environments, were robots are expected to exhibit advancedcognitive skills, such as: object recognition, natural language interaction, task planning withpossible dynamic re-planning, ability to cooperate with other robots or humans, etc.",
